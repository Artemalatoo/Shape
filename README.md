1. I created interface for methods that i will use in subclasses it's surfaceArea()
and volume(); In each subclasses i wrote radius attrubute with private modifier and
constractors. Then for each geometrical figures i used special solution by 
using my methond and with help of Math.PI. Everywhere used toString for output.
2. In main class i created random and shape instances where i used them in array
i wrote random number from 1 to 9 and 3 switches for them and checked if the
shape == null or not.
